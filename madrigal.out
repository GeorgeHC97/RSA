i inherited a dark forest where i seldom walk but a day is coming when the
living and the dead change places then the forest starts moving we are not
without hope the worst crime remains unsolved despite the efforts of many
police in the same way there is a great unsolved love in our lives
i inherited a dark forest but today I am walking in the other forest the light one
and the living things that sing wiggle wave and crawl it is spring and the air is
very strong i have an examination at the university of forgetfullness and am
as emptyhanded as the shirt on the clothesline.
